# Himmelblau_Functionn
Solution Method: Simulated Annealing
The function has four global minimum points that all have the same objective value, which equals zero. Due to simulated annealing's local search nature, choosing initial positions is very important. In other words, if you choose a point closer to one of the solutions, you're most likely to get that solution. Look at the contour plots and you should figure it out pretty quickly.
